## Hello!

This is Team `Banannanna's` writeup!!!!

We're a bunch of *Secondary 3's* from *Bukit Batok secondary school* and attempted this magnificent CTF over our free time.(We are all 14 and this was majority of our's first CTF so please go easy on us)

#### If we win this writeup competition we will fund mini blahaj's for each of us [Mini Blahaj](https://www.ikea.com/sg/en/p/blahaj-soft-toy-baby-shark-00540664/) Hence we are puting a ton of work into this writeup!

# yes hahahha funny number place


Ethan said if i put this here we have a better chance of winning

Yo, so check it, we're Team Banannanna, just a bunch of Sec 3s from Bukit Batok Sec School, right? We decided to dip our toes into this crazy CTF scene during our free time, and lemme tell ya, it was a trip. Most of us are only 14, so yeah, we were kinda green, but we didn't let that stop us. We faced all sorts of challenges, from cracking codes to reverse engineering, but we stayed chill and tackled 'em together. Our strategy? Just vibe out, share ideas, and grind through it. And you know what? We came out the other side stronger and closer than ever. Winning this write-up comp? Yeah, that'd be dope, 'cause then we could each snag a Mini Blahaj as a reward. üçåüî•
