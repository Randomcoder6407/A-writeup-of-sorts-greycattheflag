## Hello!

This is Team `Banannanna's` writeup!!!!

We're a bunch of *Secondary 3's* from *Bukit Batok secondary school* and attempted this magnificent CTF over our free time.(We are all 14 and this was majority of our's first CTF so please go easy on us)

#### If we win this writeup competition we will fund mini blahaj's for each of us [Mini Blahaj](https://www.ikea.com/sg/en/p/blahaj-soft-toy-baby-shark-00540664/) Hence we are puting a ton of work into this writeup!

![](https://github.com/saumilthecode/A-writeup-of-sorts-greycattheflag-/blob/main/Images/SCR-20240425-qnwt.png?raw=true)

We attempted the following challenges

*  The Real GreyCTF survey
*  Cats At The Beach
*  Sanity Check
*  Out In Plain Sight (we didn't get the flag in time)
