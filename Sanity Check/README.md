A breakdown

The Challenge consists of a weird link with the prefix of discord.gg

Our best guesses led us to belive that it would be either a file stored on the Discord INC servers or it would be a link to a server.

Well since our best teammate ETHAN DALGADO (he got 0 solves) realised that a file stored on discord servers would have the prefix of media.discordapp.net as visible in this link

Well since its a discord link we have no other choice but to join the discord server.
