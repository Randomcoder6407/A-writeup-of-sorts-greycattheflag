as we can see, there is a very suspicious link which seems to be a Google Form (image-related)

How to solve it?

well despite our best attempts of getting a VPN up and running to prevent ourselves from getting a DDOS attack, the VPN did not work and we were subject to the horrors of the Google Form.

Well since this seems to be some sort of Feedback Form, we all decided the good thing to do would be to leave good feedback.
so in conclusion,

1. open the very suspicious link
2. Type in team name
3. Reconfirm your allegiance to Singapore
4. Tell organizers which advertising method worked
5. Put everything for "How difficult was each category?" to "Very hard"
6. Put everything for "How fun was each category?" to "Didn't attempt" except for the "Miscellaneous"(we love miscellaneous)
![](https://github.com/saumilthecode/A-writeup-of-sorts-greycattheflag/blob/main/Images/SCR-20240426-jfkv.png?raw=true)
7. next, there is a question which reads "If you mentioned that the challenges were fun, what was fun and why? If it was a bad experience, what was bad and why?" 
as we mentioned before, this seems to be a feedback form hence, we must give our very honest feedback
![](https://github.com/saumilthecode/A-writeup-of-sorts-greycattheflag/blob/main/Images/SCR-20240426-jgld.png?raw=true)

8. again, we are faced with a question that reads "What is one thing that can be improved on in the event?". Once again, we **Must** leave our honest feedback
![](https://github.com/saumilthecode/A-writeup-of-sorts-greycattheflag/blob/main/Images/SCR-20240426-jgyx.png?raw=true)

9. next, there's a question which reads "Apart from challenges, what is one thing that was good in the CTF?" 
well for my team, we really like the Carinux guy so we left our ***HONEST*** feedback
![](https://github.com/saumilthecode/A-writeup-of-sorts-greycattheflag/blob/main/Images/SCR-20240426-jhgw.png?raw=true)

10. Next, there's a question which reads "What challenges did you like the most?"
As, once again this is a _***FEEDBACK FORM***_ we left our honest feedback 
![](https://github.com/saumilthecode/A-writeup-of-sorts-greycattheflag/blob/main/Images/SCR-20240426-jkca.png?raw=true)

![](https://github.com/saumilthecode/A-writeup-of-sorts-greycattheflag/blob/main/Images/SCR-20240426-jjpv.png?raw=true)

11. Next, there's a question which reads "What challenge(s) did you dislike the most?"
well, we left our honest feedback 

![](https://github.com/saumilthecode/A-writeup-of-sorts-greycattheflag/blob/main/Images/SCR-20240426-jhmi.png?raw=true)

12. Furthermore, there is a question which reads "Will you participate again in the future?" 

since we loved the person called Caprinux we put down "Yes"

![](https://github.com/saumilthecode/A-writeup-of-sorts-greycattheflag/blob/main/Images/SCR-20240426-jhql.png?raw=true)

13. And lastly, we filled in the last question which read "Any other feedback for us? We'd love to hear from you!"

![](https://github.com/saumilthecode/A-writeup-of-sorts-greycattheflag/blob/main/Images/SCR-20240426-jhph.png?raw=true)

After completing all these Painful steps, we finally pressed the submit button.
with the submit button pressed, we were greeted by this screen

![](https://github.com/saumilthecode/A-writeup-of-sorts-greycattheflag/blob/main/Images/SCR-20240426-jnqy.png?raw=true)

since we have the background knowledge that the flag is in the format "grey{...}"
we first submitted the flag ``grey{...}``
however, it did not accept. So, we decided to try the flag that we see on the page, ```grey{1_h0p3_yOu_3njOy3d!!!!!!}``` and it accepted

---
Conclusion

The flag was ```grey{1_h0p3_yOu_3njOy3d!!!!!!}```

The CTF was fun

Don't give up if your flag doesn't get accepted on the first try!!

We hope this wins us a prize!!!! 
	
###### If we don't win anything we would love merch even
