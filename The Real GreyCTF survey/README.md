as we can see, there is a very suspicious link which seems to be a Google Form (image related)

How to solve?

well despite our best attempts of getting a VPN up and running to prevent ourselves from getting a DDOS attack, the VPN did not work and we were subject to the horrors of the Google Form.

Well since this seems to be some sort of Feedback Form, we all decided the good thing to do would be to leave good feedback.
so in conclusion,

1. open the very suspicious link
2. Type in team name
3. Reconfirm your alligence to Singapore
4. Put everything for "How difficult was each category?" to "very hard"
5. Put everything for "How fun was each category?" to "Didn't attempt" except for the "Misellaneous"(we love misellanous)
