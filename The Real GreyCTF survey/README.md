as we can see, there is a very suspicious link which seems to be a Google Form (image related)

How to solve?

well despite our best attempts of getting a VPN up and running to prevent ourselves from getting a DDOS attack, the VPN did not work and we were subject to the horrors of the Google Form.

Well since this seems to be some sort of Feedback Form, we all decided the good thing to do would be to leave good feedback.
so in conclusion,

1. open the very suspicious link
2. Type in team name
3. Reconfirm your alligence to Singapore
4. Put everything for "How difficult was each category?" to "very hard"
5. Put everything for "How fun was each category?" to "Didn't attempt" except for the "Misellaneous"(we love misellanous)

6. next, there is a question which reads "If you mentioned that the challenges were fun, what was fun and why? If it was a bad experience, what was bad and why?" 
as we mentioned before, this seems to be a feedback form hence, we must give our very honest feedback

7. again, we are faced with a question that reads "What is one thing that can be improved on in the event?". Once again, we **Must** leave our honest feedback

8. next, theres a question which reads "Apart from challenges, what is one thing that was good in the CTF?" 
well for my team,we really likes the carinux guy so we left our ***HONEST*** feedback
![](https://github.com/saumilthecode/A-writeup-of-sorts-greycattheflag/blob/main/Images/SCR-20240426-jhgw.png?raw=true)

9. Next, theres a question which reads "What challenges did you like the most?"
As,once again this is a _***FEEDBACK FORM***_ we left our honest feedback
